# Fantasy-Translator-Extension

A fantasy-themed translator that role-plays your messages or auto-generates replies in character on Roll20 based on a small amount of chat history and auto-inputs results into chat box, ready to send. Works on other websites, but only with direct translation (no history is taken in for auto-replies) and it will not auto-input into the chat box - you would need to simply copy and paste from the pop-up to your text box.

Note: This extension was never promoted - only created (with the help of ChatGPT) and tested by me. It worked as intended, but we decided not to pursue it. It currently is not working due to the free trial end on Railway.
