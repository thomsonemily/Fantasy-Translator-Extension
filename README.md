# Fantasy-Translator-Extension

A fantasy-themed translator that role-plays your messages or auto-generates replies in character on Roll20 based on a small amount of chat history and auto-inputs results into chat box, ready to send. Works on other websites, but only with direct translation (no history is taken in for auto-replies) and it will not auto-input into the chat box - you would need to simply copy and paste from the pop-up to your text box.

Note: This extension was never promoted - only created and tested by me. It works as intended, but we decided not to pursue it.
